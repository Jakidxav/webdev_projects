In this project, I want to showcase my ability to use asynchronous Javascript using the `fetch`, `async` and `await` keywords. I also handled Promises using `try/catch` blocks when rendering the project. The helper methods and CSS code was given to me, as well as a starter file for the `main.js`, but all of the asynchronous JavaScript code is my own.

I signed up for the [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current) APIs to create a travel website. After getting a developer account for both sites, I fetched the forecast and 3 interesting venues for a given city by querying the API using custom URLs. Now, you can enter in any city in the world (as long as it is within the Foursquare and OpenWeather databases) and you will get the current weather conditions and 3 of the top attractions in that city. Try it for yourself! Register with both APIs and use the keys you get to test the website.
