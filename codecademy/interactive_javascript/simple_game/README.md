In this Codecademy project, I was tasked with constructing a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. I wrote all of the code for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a dynamic website. This project shows that I can build and style a simple website, but also add JavaScript functionality through scripts and event listeners.

At the start of the game, you will see 3 closed doors.
<p align="center">
  <img src="start_game.png" alt="starting game image"/>
</p>

Your goal is to click through the doors and avoid the robot, which changes position every game. If you make it through the game, you should see something like this:
<p align="center">
  <img src="win_game.png" alt="win game image"/>
</p>

The game button displays a new message, and you can click the button to restart the game if you want to play again.
