I was tasked with updating the website of an online music store, Musicon. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this website stylish and interactive.

Musicon has three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. The HTML and CSS files for the home and store pages were set up beforehand, but I made the following changes:
- Created a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes
- Styled the website further and created the contacts page
- Built out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
- Displayed relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers
