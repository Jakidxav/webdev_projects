Welcome to this repository! It contains my projects for the [Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design) Specialization on Coursera through the University of Michigan. It covers the basics of HTML and CSS, adding interactivity to web pages with JavaScript, and applying responsive design to enable web pages to be viewed by various devices using Bootstrap.
