Here are some of my personal coding projects from websites like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). For the most part, I have been studying full-stack web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Codecademy, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp.
