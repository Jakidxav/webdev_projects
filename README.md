Here are some of my personal coding projects from websites like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). For the most part, I have been studying full-stack web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Codecademy. On Udacity, I have enrolled in the C++ and Blockchain Developer Nanodegrees as well as the Front-End Developer program.
